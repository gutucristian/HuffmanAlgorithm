17 of the given bigrams are considered efficient as they slightly reduce the total
entropy from 4.1846 to 4.1845. This is calculated by subtracting the bigram 
frequency from each of the monograms that make it up while also adding the bigram
to the Huffman dictionary. If the entropy for this new alphabet is smaller than the 
original English alphabet then the bigram helps to reduce the entropy. In such a case we 
add the bigram and continue a similar proccess for all the bigrams in the alphabet. 
Further, while these 17 bigrams reduce the english alphabet entropy we can actually
have the alphabet entropy even lower if we disregard certain binomials. One instance
were this can be seen is if we just include the "qu" binomial and have a total entropy 
of 4.1840. Knowing this it is clear that even though there are 17 binomials which help reduce the entropy
there are cases in which we can remove some binomials and still get a better entropy.
