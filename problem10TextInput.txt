An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (al
so
referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of
electronic circuits on one small plate ("chip") of
semiconductor material, normally silicon. This can be made
much smaller than a discrete circuit made from independent
components. ICs can be made very compact, having up to severa
l
billion transistors and other electronic components in an a
rea
the size of a fingernail. The width of each conducting line in
a circuit can be made smaller and smaller as the technology
advances.
ICs were made possible by experimental discoveries showing
that semiconductor devices could perform the functions of
vacuum tubes and by mid-twentieth-century technology adva
ncements
in semiconductor device fabrication. The integration of la
rge
numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip was an enormous
improvement over the manual assembly of circuits using
discrete electronic components. The integrated circuit’s
mass
production capability, reliability, and building-block
approach to circuit design ensured the rapid adoption of
standardized integrated circuits in place of designs using
discrete transistors.
There are two main advantages of ICs over discrete circuits:
cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, with all
their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography
rather than being constructed one transistor at a
time. Furthermore, much less material is used to construct a
packaged IC die than to construct a discrete
circuit. Performance is high because the components switch
quickly and consume little power (compared to their discret
e
counterparts) as a result of the small size and close proximity of the components.
